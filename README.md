Project Title: HR Analytics using Power BI

In this project, I used Power BI to analyze HR data and provide insights into workforce trends and performance. The dashboard included key metrics such as employee headcount, attrition rate, department-wise distribution, gender diversity, and average tenure. The analysis helped identify patterns in employee turnover, areas with high attrition, and potential factors affecting employee retention. This project demonstrated the use of data visualization for strategic decision-making in human resource management.
